This is a post about load testing with Prefect. Prefect is a workflow management system that allows you to build, schedule and monitor workflows. It is a great tool for building data pipelines and automating data processing. It is also a great tool for load testing.

## What is load testing?

Load testing is a type of performance testing that is used to determine how a system behaves under a specific load. It is used to determine the maximum number of users that a system can handle before it starts to slow down or crash. Load testing is also used to determine the maximum number of requests that a system can handle before it starts to slow down or crash.
